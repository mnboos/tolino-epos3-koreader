# How to install Koreader on a Tolino Epos 3

1. Download the [Novalauncher APK](https://novalauncher.com/apk/NovaLauncher_8.1.1.apk)
2. Download [Koreader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases) and choose an `ARM` version like `koreader-android-arm-v2025.04.apk`
3. Copy both `.apk` files to the root folder of your tolino
4. Open the search function on your Tolino, enter `112358132fb` and press search. This will then open the debug menu.
5. Navigate to the section where you can install apps. It should automatically detect both apks and offer to install them. Do it. There will be an error at the end of each installation. Don't worry, it worked anyway.
6. Restart your tolino and select Novalauncher as default.
7. Start Koreader (you can also create a shortcut by pressing and holding (just like on your Mobilephone)).
8. Optionally download a dictionary: [German](https://www.reader-dict.com/de/download/de), [English](https://www.reader-dict.com/de/download/en)
9. You can now also install a dictionary directly through Koreader: Open an ebook, make a drag-gesture from the top left, click the magnifier glass, choose "Einstellungen" (Settings) -> `Wörterbuch Einstellungen` -> `Wörterbücher heruntenlader`. Alterna
